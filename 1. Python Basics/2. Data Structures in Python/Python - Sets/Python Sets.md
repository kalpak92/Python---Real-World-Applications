# Python Sets

A set is an unordered collection of items. Every element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (which cannot be changed).

However, the set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

Sets can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference etc.

## How to create a set?

A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma or by using the built-in function `set()`.

It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.). But a set cannot have a mutable element, like [list](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list), set or [dictionary](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary), as its element.

```python
# set of integers
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
print(my_set)
```

Try the following examples as well.

```python
# set do not have duplicates
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set = {1,2,3,4,3,2}
print(my_set)

# set cannot have mutable items
# here [3, 4] is a mutable list
# If you uncomment line #12,
# this will cause an error.
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

#my_set = {1, 2, [3, 4]}

# we can make set from a list
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set = set([1,2,3,2])
print(my_set)
```

Creating an empty set is a bit tricky.

Empty curly braces {} will make an empty dictionary in Python. To make a set without any elements we use the `set()` function without any argument.

```python
# initialize a with {}
a = {}

# check data type of a
# Output: <class 'dict'>
print(type(a))

# initialize a with set()
a = set()

# check data type of a
# Output: <class 'set'>
print(type(a))
```

## How to change a set in Python?

Sets are mutable. But since they are unordered, indexing have no meaning.

We cannot access or change an element of set using indexing or slicing. Set does not support it.

We can add single element using the `add()` method and multiple elements using the `update()` method. The `update()` method can take [tuples](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tuple), lists, [strings](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string) or other sets as its argument. In all cases, duplicates are avoided.

```python
# initialize my_set
my_set = {1,3}
print(my_set)

# if you uncomment line 9,
# you will get an error
# TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing

#my_set[0]

# add an element
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(2)
print(my_set)

# add multiple elements
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.update([2,3,4])
print(my_set)

# add list and set
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
my_set.update([4,5], {1,6,8})
print(my_set)
```

When you run the program, the output will be:

```python
{1, 3}
{1, 2, 3}
{1, 2, 3, 4}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
```

## How to remove elements from a set?

A particular item can be removed from set using methods, `discard()` and `remove()`.

**The only difference between the two is that, while using `discard()` if the item does not exist in the set, it remains unchanged. But `remove()` will raise an error in such condition.**

The following example will illustrate this.

```python
# initialize my_set
my_set = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
print(my_set)

# discard an element
# Output: {1, 3, 5, 6}
my_set.discard(4)
print(my_set)

# remove an element
# Output: {1, 3, 5}
my_set.remove(6)
print(my_set)

# discard an element
# not present in my_set
# Output: {1, 3, 5}
my_set.discard(2)
print(my_set)

# remove an element
# not present in my_set
# If you uncomment line 27,
# you will get an error.
# Output: KeyError: 2

#my_set.remove(2)
```

Similarly, we can remove and return an item using the `pop()` method.

Set being unordered, there is no way of determining which item will be popped. It is completely arbitrary.

We can also remove all items from a set using `clear()`.

```python
# initialize my_set
# Output: set of unique elements
my_set = set("HelloWorld")
print(my_set)

# pop an element
# Output: random element
print(my_set.pop())

# pop another element
# Output: random element
my_set.pop()
print(my_set)

# clear my_set
#Output: set()
my_set.clear()
print(my_set)
```

## Python Set Operations

Sets can be used to carry out mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference. We can do this with operators or methods.

Let us consider the following two sets for the following operations.

```
>>> A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
>>> B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Set Union

![Set Union in Python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/set-union.jpg)

Union of A and B is a set of all elements from both sets.

Union is performed using `|` operator. Same can be accomplished using the method `union()`.

```python
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use | operator
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
print(A | B)
```

Try the following examples on Python shell.

```python
# use union function
>>> A.union(B)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use union function on B
>>> B.union(A)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

### Set Intersection

![Set Intersection in Python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/set-intersection.jpg)

Intersection of A and B is a set of elements that are common in both sets.

Intersection is performed using `&` operator. Same can be accomplished using the method `intersection()`.

```python
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use & operator
# Output: {4, 5}
print(A & B)
```

Try the following examples on Python shell.

```python
# use intersection function on A
>>> A.intersection(B)
{4, 5}

# use intersection function on B
>>> B.intersection(A)
{4, 5}
```

### Set Difference

![Set Difference in Python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/set-difference.jpg)

Difference of A and B (A - B) is a set of elements that are only in A but not in B. Similarly, B - A is a set of element in B but not in A.

Difference is performed using `-` operator. Same can be accomplished using the method `difference()`.

```python
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use - operator on A
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
print(A - B)
```

Try the following examples on Python shell.

```python
# use difference function on A
>>> A.difference(B)
{1, 2, 3}

# use - operator on B
>>> B - A
{8, 6, 7}

# use difference function on B
>>> B.difference(A)
{8, 6, 7}
```

### Set Symmetric Difference

![Set Symmetric Difference in Python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/set-symmetric-difference.jpg)

Symmetric Difference of A and B is a set of elements in both A and B except those that are common in both.

Symmetric difference is performed using `^` operator. Same can be accomplished using the method `symmetric_difference()`.

```python
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use ^ operator
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
print(A ^ B)
```

Try the following examples on Python shell.

```python
# use symmetric_difference function on A
>>> A.symmetric_difference(B)
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

# use symmetric_difference function on B
>>> B.symmetric_difference(A)
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
```

## Other Set Operations

### Set Membership Test

We can test if an item exists in a set or not, using the keyword `in`.

```python
# initialize my_set
my_set = set("apple")

# check if 'a' is present
# Output: True
print('a' in my_set)

# check if 'p' is present
# Output: False
print('p' not in my_set)
```

### Iterating Through a Set

Using a for loop, we can iterate though each item in a set.

```python
>>> for letter in set("apple"):
...     print(letter)
...    
a
p
e
l
```

### Built-in Functions with Set

Built-in functions like `all()`, `any()`, `enumerate()`, `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sorted()`, `sum()` etc. are commonly used with set to perform different tasks.

| Function                                                     | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [all()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/all) | Return `True` if all elements of the set are true (or if the set is empty). |
| [any()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/any) | Return `True` if any element of the set is true. If the set is empty, return `False.` |
| [enumerate()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/enumerate) | Return an enumerate object. It contains the index and value of all the items of set as a pair. |

## Python Frozenset

Frozenset is a new class that has the characteristics of a set, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned. While tuples are immutable lists, frozensets are immutable sets.

Sets being mutable are unhashable, so they can't be used as dictionary keys. On the other hand, frozensets are hashable and can be used as keys to a dictionary.

Frozensets can be created using the function `frozenset()`.

This datatype supports methods like `copy()`, `difference()`, `intersection()`, `isdisjoint()`, `issubset()`, `issuperset()`, `symmetric_difference()` and `union()`. Being immutable it does not have method that add or remove elements.

```python
# initialize A and B
A = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
B = frozenset([3, 4, 5, 6])
```

Try these examples on Python shell.

```python
>>> A.isdisjoint(B)
False
>>> A.difference(B)
frozenset({1, 2})
>>> A | B
frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})
>>> A.add(3)
...
AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```
